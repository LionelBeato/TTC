    <h2>That McDonalds On Albany</h2>

    ></a>
    <p>This McDonalds is pretty much open at all hours. Rest assured that at any given early Tuesday at 4 o'clock in the morning, I will be ordering a McGriddle. Slap a red ball on my nose and call me Bubbles 'cause I love clown food.</p>

    <h2>My Kitchen Sometimes</h2>

    <p><a href="my_kitchen.html">Check it out!</a> I do a lot of the cooking at my house so I keep a tight and orderly ship. Sure, I burn a lot of the entrees and the iron cast-skillet might be rusting in a cabinet somewhere, but everything I cook I cook with love. And MSG.</p>

    <p>The guys here are surly but I love their food. I wish they'd stop yelling about my card getting declined. I get it, I'm poor. You don't have to rub it in. </p>

    <p>I can show you the rolls. Shining, Shimmering gyros. Tell me viewer, now when did you last have lambs over rice?</p>

    <p>This is not a restaurant but I feel like it needs to be included. It's pretty much a 7-11 you can order from but geared specifically towards those inclined to have the munchies. I have very few adult vices. I just eat a lot.</p>
